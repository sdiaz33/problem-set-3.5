        Range and Habitat
      </h2>
      <p id="paragraph1">
        Grizzly bears are found many different habitats, from dense forests to subalpine meadows, open plains and artic tundra. In North America, grizzly bears are found in western Canada, Alaska, Wyoming Idaho, and a potentially small population in Washington. Historically, they could be found from Alaska to Mexico ad from California to Ohio.

        <span>DID YOU KNOW?: Grizzly bears have a better sense of smell than a hound dog and can detect food from miles away.</span>

        Diet
      </h2>
      <p id="paragraph2">
        Grizzly bears are omnivores, and their diet can vary widely. They may eat seeds, berries, roots, grasses, fungi, deer, elk, fish, dead animals, and insects. In the late summer and early fall, grizzlies enter hyperphagia, a period of 2-4 months when they intesify their calorie intake to put on weight for winter denning. During this time period they can gain more than three pounds a day!

        Population
      </h2>
      <p id="paragraph3">
        Though still common in much of Alaska, British Columbia and Alberta, grizzly bears have been reduced in the lower 48 states from an estimated historical population of 50,000 to only about 1,800 today in five small isolated populations. Most of these grizzly bears are located in Montana's Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (including Glacier National Park) and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
